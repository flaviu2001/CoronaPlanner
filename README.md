# CoronaPlanner

A Coronavirus themed android app made at [ITFest Hackathon 2020](https://itfest.sisc.ro/hackathon/index.html).

This app aims to make it easy to keep informed about the state of coronavirus in most countries by parsing the website of the [Romanian's Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mae.ro/en).

It also parses information related to the number of cases, deaths, tests and total population for each country from [Worldometer.com](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

Lastly you may generate pdf documents completing your name, address and other information which you may print and sign for leaving your household after 23:00 (a recent law required people to hold such a paper between 23:00 and 5:00).
